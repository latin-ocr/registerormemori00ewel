01(1 road 10 Kingston lay Lymecroft field (p. 133), the largest
01 1119 northern furlongs. Lymecroft was bounded 011 1119
1101111 by Roberd 811991 (p. 29), which is the beginning 01
1119 present Chessington road that now meets the Kingston
road in Ewell by the horsepond. As late as 1785 there was
a second ford 11919, 1119 111791· running between these two
roads; 1119 present road-bridge was made 111 1119 91089 01 1119

belong. Thus Roberd 811991 did not 91088 1119 111791, but
starting 011 1119 1911 bank it led on past Fitznell's and the
lane adjoining it leading 10 Cherleinannes mede (p. 20), 111911
known as Fitznell’s Lane and later as Northcroft Lane, after

further on. This road now 1011118 1119 boundary 01 Ewell
parish on 1119 west, and it can scarcely have been other than
the old Epson] and Kingston rond in 1408, 1119 intermediate
piece between Gibrnltar and the grass lane being now missing.
It may have gone to Talworth by the Rnxley lane or by
the footpatli from Bonesgate, or possibly 171ιί Hook 10
Kingston .

The “ description 01 1119 17111 ” given in the Memoria] may
be suminarized in a general way as follows :—

The first Bound (pp. 2—5) describes 1119 houses upon the
Kingston rond, beginning near Beggars Hill. Teppes Lane
seems to coincide with Mill Lane, and Austynes Lane with
the lane that led from 1119 old church to the Spring Hotel
before the present church was built.

houses lying between 1119 Parsons Lane and Church 811991,

respectively‚ adjoining the Bound previously given. After
this we pass to Codyngton 811991.
