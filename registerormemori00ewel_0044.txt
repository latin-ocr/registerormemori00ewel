KVaste ground or river of Ewell lately inclosed with a stone
Wall, and within the same a little banquetting House late
61661611 and Ponds and fish therein within the same
enclosure ¹* (Taylor's Surregs). A marginal note adds that
this enclosure had been made about thirty years previously
by several of the inhabitants and tenants of Ewell (pre-
sumably 115 a public 61161051116), but in 1577 it belonged to
Nifflilas Saunders, 1116 owner of the mansion. This enclosure
occupied half a 10011, and must have been the beginning of
the ornainental water 111 the grounds of Garbrand Hall.

In 1408 there were 111 houses 111 Ewell, and if the word
toft 15 intended to signify a plot of ground where a house
formerly stood, there must have been, evidently before the
Black Death, 166 houses, since 55 tofts are mentioned
scattered here and there, or in gro ups 1308611161, all over the
village. About 75 01 these tenants of the houses held land
in the Common Field. In 1577 111616 were but 56 houses 111
Ewell, besides a few outlyiug cottages, and only 42 tenants
of land, one or two being fairly large 110111615, and the land
was still in cultivation. Between 1577 and 1801 1116 tenants
had ceased to cultivate, the 1111101185 were ‘⁶ handed over to
oblivion,'' and the owners had so entirely neglected their
rights that the Southfield lapsed into common down. In
Cary's Enylsish Atlas down-land coloured green extends
almost to the outskirts of the village. The Commons
Enclosure Act of 1801 gave the land 11110 the hands of the
leading residents in order that it might be cultivated, on
account of the shortage of wheat caused by the war. The
Survcys reveal that this cultivation was not 111 the case of
the &outhfield a new departure, but an agricultural renewal.

A compar-ison of the two Surveys brings to light some
curicus examples of name. corruption. In 1577 1116 spring
of the river is named Kattswell‚ obviously derived from the
Cakeswell of 1408, which in its 111111 was 110 doubt corrupted
from some earlier source3 possibly the original name was
St. Catherinc's Well. Another instance is found in “the
Common called Oherleniannes mede '' (p. 20), which in 1577

is thus described: “The Ohurohwardens of Ewell hold to
