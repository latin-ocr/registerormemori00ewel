XX INTRODUOTION.

One piece (p. 118) contained. 20 acres9 held “together'’ by
the Prior.

The lands on the noi-th of the vill were very different to
those 011 1110 south. They are spoken of as “fields,” and
are subdivided into ⁸·cultui¹a¹‚⁷’ two of which are called
“t‘urltmgss' As already observed, the 11110110103011 arable
acres ure only 73, ot* which :37 are in 11 “field called Lyine-
erot‘t.’' Seventy—eight acres of wood are also open and mixed
with the 111-111110. Τ1101·0 were two enclosed pieces of “land
and ineadow ’³ containing 20 acres each, and an enclosed
“field Called Richardest'ehlss’ t-he contents of which are not
giren.

Besides these lands specified as on the north ot* the vill,
the 11011103110 11111113 of the manor, described on pp. 158 to 163,
were also in that direction. Some of the “pieces'’ on pp. 160
and 161 were in the Southfield. But the pieces called
‘⁶ le worth '' and ‘⁶ 10 Greteworthfeld‚” containing· in all over
260 acres,111ust11ave been in the north. The date of this
description may be that ot* the Gustum-al, which it follows.

Ewell and &clyti-(stenw—Miss Glyn thinks that the direc-
tion of the main roads as traceable in early document-s
points to t-he superior importance of the latter of the two
places in early times. On the other hand, ecclesiastica] evi-
dence rather indicates the imperta-nce of Ewell. From 1110
earliest times Ewell gave its name to 0110 of the ancient
Deaneries 111 1110 Diocese of Winchest-er, which were probably
instituted soon after the N ornian Conquest. The County of
Suri-ey was divided into only three Deaneries, of Which
Sonthwark conlprised the parishes near London, while the
remainder of the county was covered by the two Deaneries
of Ewcll 011 1110 east and Guildford 011 the west. It 13 true
that 11 Deauery ways frequently called from one ot* its less
important pmishes, and 111 11113 case Kingston decidedly took
the lead ot' Ewell. But judging by our earliest evidence, the
Taxation of Pope Nicholus 111 1291, Kingston was followed
by Ewell and Letherhead. Kingston wass valued at 3380,
Ewelle at ,133 (js. Sd„ Leddrede at „234 133. These were
among the highest values in the whole count-y. Codyngton
