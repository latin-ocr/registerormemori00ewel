THE TOPOGRAPHY OF EWELL.

111 is renuirkuble that there exist two early Surveys of
Ewell : 1116 ,1[ν)ηω·ίι1ῖ of 1408, contained in the present
10101116, und 1116 81111163] of Ewell Parish, taken in 1577 by
Thomas Tuylor, 111611 Surveyor of the County of Suri-ey.
From the topogruphical point 01 view these two Surveys‚
notwithstanding their very diverse literary 61131361616-1116
0116 written in mediaeval Latin, the other in the Elizabethan
vernacular—are so much the complenient of one another
11131 11 is scarcely possible to understand either without
3 study of both document-s. The later Survey 1136 1116

whereas 1116 Memoria] 1136 1116 best indication ot' 1116 relative
positions of 1116 “surlongs ’³ into which 1116 1311116 of the
pai-ish were divided.

Ι had hoped to have drawn both the accompanying plans
frou] the Memorial, but in the case of the “vill'' 11116 proved
impossible. It will be seen in the text 11131- 110 3616336 16

and the reader is 3160 groping 31161· his directi0n‚ “and 111611
next ‘⁹' becomes but 3 vain repetition. Therefore I have had
to substitute the Ewell of 1577. This plan gives the names
ot' the householders of Ewell and the approximate outlines
of 1116111611611161116. 111 3 few cases where the name of the
