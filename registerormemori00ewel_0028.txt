THE 'rOPOGRAPHY OF EWELL.

lT is renmrkuble 111111 111010 exist two early Surveys Of
Ewell : 1110 „umam-fal 01 MOS, contained in the present
volume, und the Sto-vegs «gf Eusell Purislz, taken in 1577 by
Thomas Tuylor, 111011 Surveyor 01 1110 County 01 Surrey.
From 1110 topographical point 01 view these two Suweys,
notwithstanding their very diverse literary characters—the
one written in niediaeval Latin, the other in the Elizabethan
vernacular—are so much the coinplenient 01 0110 another
111111 11 18 scarcely possible to understand either without
11 study 01 both documents. The later Survey has the
advantage 01 11- 010111· and consistent description of the “towns‘'
whereas the Memorial has the best indication 01 1110 relative
positions 01 1110 “furlongs ’' into which the 11111118 01 1110
parish were divided.

Ι had hoped 10 have drawn both the accompanying plans
from 1110 Memorial, but in the case 01 1110 “vill” this proved
impossible. 11 will be seen in the text 111111- no acreage is
given, 111111 when the starting-point described is uncertain,
111111 1110 10111101· 18 also groping 111101· 1118 (1110011011, “and 111011
next ” becomes but a vain repetition. Therefore I have had
10 substitute the Ewell 01 1577. Τ1118 plan gives the names
01111011011801111111018 of Ewell and the approximate outlines
01111011·1011011101118. In a few cases where the name 01 1110
house was mentioned it is 11180 inserted. The plan 01 Evvell
purish shows 1111ὶ probable outlines 01 the furlongs 118 given
in 1111· anoriul. 1110-011101· with those 01 1110 old roads. It
will be seen 111111 these t'urlongs are not always 01 the exact
ful-long width——in some 011808 considerably wider—and while
the agricultural furlong may have averaged its correct width,
1110 woods evidently supplied an uncertain factor. There is
110 reason 10 suppose 111111 the acreage recorded is incorrect,
but its exact distribution is in many cases a matter of
